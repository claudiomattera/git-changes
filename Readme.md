# Git Changelog

An application for generating a changelog from git commit tree

<https://gitlab.com/claudiomattera/git-changelog>


Installation
----

Executables can be downloaded in the [releases page](./releases).

If the executable `git-changelog` is put inside a directory included in the `PATH` environment variable, a new git subcommand `changelog` is available.

~~~~shell
git changelog /path/to/git/repository > changelog.txt
~~~~


### Installation from Source

This is a Rust application and can be installed using Cargo.

~~~~shell
cargo install git-changelog
~~~~


Usage
----

This application makes the following assumptions about the git commit tree.

* Version names follow [Semantic Versioning] format;
* Available versions are encoded in git tags (tags not matching the format are ignored);
* Versions are developed in sequence;
* Changes are encoded in commits following a certain format (commit not matching such format are ignored).

The application looks at the commit tree and considers all changes between each pair of subsequent versions.
then it creates a Markdown changelog listing all changes for each version and prints it to standard output.

### Example

Consider the following commit log.

|\
| * d65a363 (v0.2.0-devel) Add file d (issue #4)
| | * b808f2d (issue/4) Add file d
| |/

| |/
| * 6ba5ad1 Start version 0.2.0
|/
*   742c7b3 (tag: 0.1.0) Merge branch 'v0.1.0-devel'
|\
| * 5053c28 (v0.1.0-devel) Add other file (issue #2)

~~~~

This application will generate the following Markdown changelog.

~~~~markdown
# Version 0.2.0 (2021-07-07)

- Add file d (issue #4)
- Add file c (issue #3)

# Version 0.1.0 (2021-07-07)

- Add other file (issue #2)
- Add file (issue #1)
~~~~


### Select and Convert Commit Messages

Commit messages are selected for changelog according to a regular expression passed via the command-line argument `--commit-regex`, and converted by substituting the pattern passed via `--commit-replacement`.
Default values are, respectively, `(.+)\s+\(issue\s+#(\d+)\)` and `${1} (issue ${2})`.

In order to include links to the repository issues in the changelog, use something like:

~~~~plain
${1} (issue [${2}](https://gitlab.com/claudiomattera/git-changelog/issues/#{2}))`
~~~~


### Include Current Head

It is possible to generate a changelog for the current head, so that it can be included in the upcoming git tag.

In the following example, the version `1.0.3` is assigned to the current head.

~~~~shell
git-changelog --include-head 1.0.3
~~~~


### Include Tag Descriptions in Changelog

The tag message can be used as a summary before the list of changes in the changelog.

~~~~shell
git-changelog --add-tag-description
~~~~

This application will generate the following Markdown changelog.

~~~~markdown
# Version 0.2.0 (2021-07-07)

This is the text in the tag message.

It can contain arbitrary text, it is not parsed as Markdown, but copied verbatim.

- Add file d (issue #4)
- Add file c (issue #3)

# Version 0.1.0 (2021-07-07)

- Add other file (issue #2)
- Add file (issue #1)
~~~~

In case tags are signed, the flag `--strip-gpg-signature` will strip the signature in the changelog.
